*GWebMAs work towards an open source structured light scanner:



= TPS_extended_I =

Open source, for Processing. Based on [http://www.openprocessing.org/visuals/?visualID=1995 Three Phase Scanner] Kyle McDonald . Re - implements parts of Florian Jennet's former Processing sketch of [http://www.mediamolecule.com/2007/12/10/homebrew-3d-scanner/ Homebrew 3D Scanner] by Alex Evans (C++):

This code is a module extracting 3D data from a serie of 3 phase images + a colored texture image to a textured triangle mesh. It expects the images as "phase1.png", "phase2.png", "phase3.png" and "tex.png" in a subfolder named "data". The default settings of the code expect images at 480x640 pixel.

e.g:
 -  textured triangulated mesh 

 -  interpolation 

 -  median filter

==Keycodes:==
===Viewmodes===
*"1" textured triangle mesh;

*"2" point cloud;

*"3" solid triangle mesh;

===Filters===

*"i" interpolate ( fill holes);

*"m" median smooth;

===Specials===

*"d" shows the coordinates system;

*"i" saves a screenshot of the current 3D view;

It`s free...  use it for nice things. But do not blame any creator...

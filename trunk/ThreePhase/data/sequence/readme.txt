To capture your own images, project these three patterns onto the scene and capture images that approximate the example images as closely as possible.

Make sure to turn down the contrast on your projector so the greys are as visible possible. Sometimes gamma correction on your video card can help.

To get the best possible results, consider normalizing the histogram of the captured images before passing them to the decoder. In Photoshop this is Ctrl+Shift+L.
